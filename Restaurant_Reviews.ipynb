        " 2. In this article, we will focus on the sentiment analysis of text data.\n",
        " 3.We, humans, communicate with each other in a variety of languages, and any language is just a mediator or a way in which we try to express ourselves. And, whatever we say has a sentiment associated with it. It might be positive or negative or it might be neutral as well.\n",
        " 4.Suppose, there is a fast-food chain company and they sell a variety of different food items like burgers, pizza, sandwiches, milkshakes, etc. They have created a website to sell their food and now the customers can order any food item from their website and they can provide reviews as well, like whether they liked the food or hated it.\n",

        "\n",
        " 1. Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.\n",
        " 2. Therefore we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in order to compute the customer perception. Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them.\n",
        " 3.In this article, we aim to analyze the sentiment of the tweets provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by developing a machine learning pipeline involving the use of three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and SVM)along with using Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 Scores."
